      <section id="about">
        <p>I am a rookie web developer native to Washington state. I started learning HTML and CSS in 2017 and decided that I liked it. I thought that web development would be a good career change for me so, with a little encouragement from my family, I decided to go to a Seattle code school called Code Fellows.</p>

        <p>It was a bit nerve racking because I had a history of losing interest and dropping out of higher education and I wasn’t certain that this endeavor wouldn’t end up the same way. In the end, I found that I really enjoy web development and the satisfaction that comes from solving problems to create a product.</p>

        <p>While I enjoy web development, it is not the only career path that interests me. I have always had an great interest in video games and would love to work towards a job in game development in the long term. For the time being however, I am ready and willing to learn and gain invaluable work experience in any computer programming field.</p>
